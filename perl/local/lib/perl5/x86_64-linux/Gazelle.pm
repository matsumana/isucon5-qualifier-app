=head1 NAME

Gazelle - Preforked Plack Handler for performance freaks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ plackup -s Gazelle --port 5003 --max-reqs-per-child 50000 \
         -E production -a app.psgi

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Gazelle is a PSGI Handler. It's created based on L<Starlet> code. 
Many code was rewritten and optimized by XS.

Gazelle supports following features.

=over

=item * supports HTTP/1.1. But does not have Keepalive.

=item * ultra fast HTTP processing using picohttpparser

=item * uses accept4(2) if OS support

=item * uses writev(2) for output responses

=item * prefork and graceful shutdown using Parallel::Prefork

=item * hot deploy and unix domain socket using Server::Starter

=back

Gazelle is suitable for running HTTP application servers behind a reverse proxy like nginx.

Benchmark is here. L<https://github.com/kazeburo/Gazelle/wiki/Benchmark>

=head1 SAMPLE CONFIGURATION WITH NGINX

nginx.conf

  http {
    upstream app {
      server unix:/path/to/app.sock;
    }
    server {
      location / {
        proxy_pass http://app;
      }
      location ~ ^/(stylesheets|images)/ {
        root /path/to/webapp/public;
      }
    }
  }

command line of running Gazelle

  $ start_server --path /path/to/app.sock --backlog 16384 -- plackup -s Gazelle \
    -workers=20 --max-reqs-per-child 1000 --min-reqs-per-child 800 -E production -a app.psgi

start_server is bundled with L<Server::Starter>

=head1 COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

In addition to the options supported by plackup, Gazelle accepts following options(s).

=head2 --max-workers=#

number of worker processes (default: 10)

=head2 --timeout=#

seconds until timeout (default: 300)

=head2 --max-reqs-per-child=#

max. number of requests to be handled before a worker process exits (default: 1000)

=head2 --min-reqs-per-child=#

if set, randomizes the number of requests handled by a single worker process between the value and that supplied by C<--max-reqs-per-child> (default: none)

=head2 --spawn-interval=#

if set, worker processes will not be spawned more than once than every given seconds.  Also, when SIGHUP is being received, no more than one worker processes will be collected every given seconds.  This feature is useful for doing a "slow-restart".  See L<http://blog.kazuhooku.com/2011/04/web-serverstarter-parallelprefork.html> for more information. (default: none)
